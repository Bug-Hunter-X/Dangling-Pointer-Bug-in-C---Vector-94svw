This example demonstrates a common error in C++ involving dangling pointers and vectors.  The code creates a vector, then obtains a pointer to its internal array.  After clearing the vector, the pointer becomes invalid. Attempting to dereference this invalid pointer leads to undefined behavior, commonly causing a crash. The solution shows how to avoid this by managing memory correctly.  See bugSolution.cpp for the corrected code.
